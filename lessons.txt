FOR BETTER OPTIMIZATION
related to downloading files/ fetching API , the issue of slow process due to network other criterion can be fixed by thinking in abstraction or delegation

rather than fetching the fot when the user needs it at that time , we can fetch the font TO a file that doesn't need data connection for accessing it, so that when the ant to fetch the font it, it takes it from a file thats not too far and doesn't need internet connection for  accessing it 

google font from the CDN -----> JSON file -----> browser

so we send to the JSON file the same time the time the browser is rendering elements
